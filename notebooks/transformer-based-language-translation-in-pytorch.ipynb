It converts text into numerical representations that are easier for machines to interpret.\n\n<br>\n\n### **Why Tokenize Text ❓**\n\nHuman communication has structure through words, sentences, grammar, and so on. Tokenization exposes this structure so that machines can discover patterns, relationships, and meaning. It splits text into smaller units called tokens that can be assigned numerical values.\n\nCommon types of tokens are:\n\n- **Words**: Words are the basic units of meaning in language, such as \"love\", \"Paris\", or \"the\".\n\n- **Subwords**: Subwords are parts of words that have some meaning or function, such as prefixes, suffixes, or stems.\n\nWithout tokenization, text is just a sequence of characters without shape or meaning. Tokens add form that machines can process.\n\n<br>\n\n### **Challenges in Tokenization 🚧**\n\nTokenizing human text is challenging because languages have complex and diverse rules:\n\n- Word spaces vary across languages. Some languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not use whitespace to separate words.\n\n- Made-up words, such as names, slang, or acronyms, may not be recognized or split correctly by tokenizers.\n\n- The same word can have different meanings depending on the context. Capturing the nuances of language is difficult for machines.\n\nGood tokenizers handle these challenges with techniques such as vocabulary lists, multi-word tokens, word splitting rules, and more.\n\n<br>\n\n### **Assigning Meaning Through Embeddings 📈**\n\nTokenization structures text, embeddings provide meaning. They map the tokens to numerical vectors that capture its information in the language. Similar tokens have similar embeddings (e.g eat & drink, walk & run, cat & dog e.t.c)\n\n**Note**: We will come back to this later...\n",

   "source": "# Using a Tokenizer 🛠️\n\nNow that you know what text tokenization is and why it is important, let's see how we can do it in practice. We will use a pretrained multi-lingual tokenizer from the **Hugging Face Tokenizers Library** for both English and French texts.\n\n**Here are some of the steps performed by the tokenizer:**\n\n1. The tokenizer uses **WordPiece**, a way to split words into smaller parts that make sense. For example, the word \"Transformer\" can be split into \"Trans\" and \"former\". This helps the computer to learn new words and save space.\n\n    WordPiece works by finding the most common parts of words in a text and combining them together. For example, if the text has many words that end with \"ing\", WordPiece will merge \"i\", \"n\", and \"g\" into one part. **This way, having seen \"eat\" and \"ing\", the model can infer the meaning of the word \"eating\".**\n\n2. It also **lowercases** the text, and splits on **whitespace** and **punctuation**. For example, the sentence \"Hello world!\" can be split into \"hello\", \"world\", and \"!\".\n\n3. It uses **special tokens** to mark the distinctions in the sentence, and to handle unknown or padding tokens. I am going to be using the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens as the beginning and ending of a sentence. For example, the sentence \"I love Paris\" will be tokenized as \"[CLS]\", \"i\", \"love\", \"paris\", \"[SEP]\".\n\nSo the special tokens are:\n- \"[CLS]\" for start of sentence\n- \"[SEP]\" for end of sentence\n- \"[UNK]\" for unknown token\n- \"[PAD]\" for padding token\n\n<br>\n📝 Technical Detail: [CLS] and [SEP] are meant as classification and separation tokens in the pretrained tokenizer, but since it does not have [SOS] and [EOS] tokens (which it shouldn't being a BERT tokenizer), I am swapping it's use.",

They are used to represent the semantic meaning of words in a way that is efficient and comparable.\n\nTo create this word embeddings, we had to tokenize the text, that is, convert the words into numbers. This assigns a unique integer to each token in the vocabulary. For example, the sentence “morning francais” was tokenized as [28757, 63184, 12985] (Note: This was the tokenization before we added our [CLS] and [SEP]).\n\nBut these numbers don’t tell us much about the words. They don’t tell us what the words mean, or how they are related to each other. For example, we don’t know if dog and cat are similar or different, or if apple and orange are fruits or colors.\n\nThat’s why we need to use an embedding layer, that maps this numbers to their corresponding vectors.\n    \n    For example:\n\n    dog -- (tokenized to 1) -- mapped to row 1 of matrix: [0.2, -0.1, 0.5, …]\n    cat -- (tokenized to 23) -- mapped to row 23 of matrix:  [0.3, -0.2, 0.4, …]\n    apple -- (tokenized to 40) -- mapped to row 40 of matrix:  [-0.1, 0.4, 0.2, …]\n    orange -- (tokenized to 22) -- mapped to row 22 of matrix:  [-0.2, 0.3, 0.1, …]\n    ...\n\nThis vectors called embeddings, are like arrows that point in different directions and have different lengths (size of the arrow not the number of elements e.g The arrow -- [0.5, 0.7] is longer than the arrow -- [0.2, 0.1] ).\n\nThis embeddings are stored in an embedding matrix and when our neural network model is being trained it tries to make the vectors match the meaning and context of the words. For example, it tries to make the vectors of similar words point in the same direction, and the vectors of different words point in different directions. It also tries to make the vectors of words that are often used together have similar lengths, and the vectors of words that are rarely used together have different lengths.\n\nThis will enable it to understand the contextual meaning of text better, but this requires training it with millions or even billions of books, texts e.t.c.\n\nThat's why it is more common to use embedding layers of models that have already been trained.\n\nNote: As you saw embedding maps the token numbers from the tokenizer to rows in the embedding matrix. This means the embedding matrix will be of size (num_rows, num_cols) -> (tokenizer_vocab_size, embed_dim) where embed_dim is the number of elements in the vector of embedding used to represent a token. Common sizes are 256, 300, 512, 786 e.t.c.\n\nNote: This also implies that the tokenizer and embedding should come from the same pre-trained model for the mapping token numbers -> Row, to match.",

   "source": "### Understanding the form of Our Dataset.\n\nThe transformer we are going to use (which we will see later) is going to have an encoder and decoder layer.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Encoder Overview 🔀\n\nThe 🕵️‍♂️ encoder creates meaningful representations of its inputs (in this case, an English sentence) 💬.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Decoder Overview 📡\n\nThe 📡 decoder then uses these representations to perform a specific task (translating to French 🇫🇷 in this example).\n\n<br>\n\n#### Translation Approach 🎯\n\nWe will implement translation using a common technique called **next token prediction** ⏭️.\n\nAt each timestep, the decoder uses the encoder's output to predict the next word in the translated sequence.  \n\n#### Example 💡\n\nFor example, to translate \"Beautiful day\" into \"Belle journée\", we first append special start `[CLS]` and end `[SEP]` tokens to the French translation:\n\n> \"[CLS] Belle journée [SEP]\"\n\nOur goal is to train the model to predict the next token at each step:\n\n1. When it sees `[CLS]`, predict \"Belle\"\n2. When it sees \"Belle\", predict \"journée\"\n3. When it sees \"journée\", predict `[SEP]` ✅  \n\n<br>\n\n#### Teacher Forcing 👩‍🏫  \n\nTraining the model with the above 👆👆 method will be very slooow.\n\nSo instead, we use a technique called **teacher forcing** 👩‍🏫.\n\nWe provide the full ground truth translation up to the `[SEP]` token to the decoder during training. Just \"`[CLS]` Belle journée\".\n\nThen we set the models target outputs to be \"Belle journée `[SEP]`\".\n\n<br>\n\n#### Causal Masking 😷  \n\nSince we are passing in the french translation to the decoder layer in training, we employ something called **causal masking** 😷 (more on this later) in the decoder to prevent it from cheating by looking at the full output translation.\n\nThis forces the model to predict the next token based only on the encoder outputs and what came before in the decoder outputs.  \n<br>\n\n#### Inference Process 🤔\n\nAt inference time, we pass an English input to the encoder and just the `[CLS]` token to the decoder initially.\n\nWe then feed the models predicted token from the previous timestep back into the decoder to predict the next token.\n\nWe continue this loop until the `[SEP]` token is predicted, indicating the ✅ end of translation.   \n<br>\n\n#### Note 📝\nIn most sequence-to-sequence models (like ours), the encoder inputs do not contain start/end tokens - those are appended to the decoder inputs only.\n\nThis allows the decoder to know when to start 🏁 and stop ✋ generating the translation.\n\n<br>\n\n#### **Batching**\nBatching allows us to make more efficient use of computing power by training on batches of sentence pairs rather than one sentence pair at a time. Processing batches enables the model to learn general linguistic patterns across sentences, rather than potentially noisy patterns within individual sentences.\n\nHowever, sentences come in varying lengths. To create same sized batches, shorter sentences will be padded with special `[PAD]` tokens to match the length of the longest sentence in the batch.\n\nWe will configured the model to ignore these pad tokens. Along with the batch of sentences, the actual lengths of each underlying sentence will also be passed to the model so it knows how much of each sentence contains real words versus padding.\n\nThis contextual information on real sentence lengths allows the model to differentiate between content words and pads inserted to standardize batch lengths.\n\n<br>\n\n\n#### **Using this information let's create the dataset for our model**",

For example, \"I love pizza\" 🍕 and \"Pizza love I\" have the same words, but different orders and meanings.\n\nWe can use positional encoding to represent the position of each word as a vector, similar to `word embeddings`. This way, we can teach a computer to understand the order and the context of the words in a sentence.\n\nThere are two ways of creating positional encoding vectors:\n\n- Fixed positional encoding: The vectors are predefined and fixed. Formulas such as sine and cosine functions is used:\n\n$$PE_{(pos,2i)} = sin(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})$$\n$$PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = cos(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})$$\n\nwhere $pos$ is the position, $i$ is the dimension and $d_{model}$ is the size of embedding dimension (number of elements in positional encoding vector). This way captures relative distances and handle variable length sentences. *`[This is what the original transformer paper did]`*.\n\n- Learned positional encoding: The vectors are randomly initialized and learned by the model. An embedding layer is used with different embeddings for each position. This way the model learns the positional information to add to the data enabling it to potentially capture more complex patterns. *`[This is what most state-of-the-art models do]`*.\n\nNote: When we are using learned positional encodings we are going to need to put a limit on the number of tokens our model can take in. This is because the position encoding layer is going to have an embedding matrix with as many rows as our max number of tokens. Its number of columns should also match those of the word embeddings because we are going to add `+` them together, this way we get a new vector that contains both the meaning and the position of each word.\n\nIn this tutorial, we use the positional encoding layer from the `pre_trained_model`. It has a token limit of 512, and our model `TOKEN_LIMIT=350` so we are good to go.\n",

But in sentences like \"Do what is Right\" and \"Shift to your Right,\" the word \"Right\" has the same tag despite differing contexts.\n\n**Enter SDPA, the party game changer!** It introduces three roles:\n\n- **Query (Q):** The curious word asking, \"Who has the information I need?\"\n- **Key (K):** Like a name tag, revealing relevant skills or knowledge.\n- **Value (V):** The actual hidden talent or information the word possesses.\n\nNow, picture each word comparing its query (e.g., \"Who has the information I need?\") with everyone's keys (e.g The information they have). The more relevant the key's information, the higher the \"attention score\" it gets. Think of it as noticing someone with a matching talent you need!\n\nBut how does everyone stay informed about these scores? This is where the **`attention weight matrix`** comes in! It's like a giant scoreboard displayed at the party, where each cell shows the attention score between a specific word pair. For example, the cell at row \"Right\" and column \"Shift\" would hold the score indicating how well these words relate.\n\nBut how does this translate into updating the word embeddings?\nThat's where **softmax** steps in, acting as the **regulator** who assigns weights to each score based on its relative importance.\n\nImagine the **regulator** listening to each word's scores and saying, \"Okay, so 'Shift' is quite relevant for determining 'Right' meaning in this context, so you get a high weight.\"\n\nHere's how softmax works its magic:\n\n1. **Listen to All Scores:** It takes all the attention scores for a specific word (a row in the our `attention weight matrix`) as input.\n\n2. **Apply the Formula:** It uses a mathematical formula to consider the relative strength of each score compared to the others. This ensures that scores that are much higher than others have a larger impact on the final weights.\n\n3. **Distribute the Weights:** Softmax transforms these relative strengths into weights between 0 and 1, ensuring everyone gets a fair share of attention but the most relevant ones get a bigger slice.\n\nNow, each word has a set of weighted values based on its interactions with others. Think of it as collecting insights from the most relevant conversations at the party. These weights are then used to perform a weighted combination of everyones values in order to create a richer, context-aware representation of the word's meaning.\n\nIn our example, \"Right\" in \"Do what is Right\" might learn a stronger \"morality\" value, while in \"Shift to your Right,\" it gains a stronger \"direction\" value.\n\n**The result? Word embeddings that truly reflect their meaning in each sentence, just like people adapting their communication based on the context!**\n\n**Bonus Math (optional):**\n\nThe core calculation behind SDPA involves the attention weight matrix and softmax, expressed as:\n\n$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{{Q.K^T}}{{\\sqrt{d_k}}}\\right) .V$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $Q$, $K$, $V$ represent the query, key, and value vectors for every word joined as rows of the corresponding matrix.\n> *Note: $K^T$ means that the matrix K was transposed, we do this to align the vectors dimensions apples to apples 🍏 before the similarity check.*\n\n- **$\\cdot$** denotes the dot product (measuring similarity).\n\n- $\\sqrt{d_k}$ is a scaling factor for stability (so very high scores don't totally drown out lower ones).\n\n- $\\text{softmax}$ distributes weights between 0 and 1 based on attention scores.\n\n- **$\\cdot$** $V$ uses the **weighted attention scores** to do a weighted combination of everyones values to get a new richer embedding.",

   "source": "#### **Multi-Head Attention**\nThis is a mechanism in the Self-Attention process where multiple \"heads\" or focus groups are used. Remember our word party? Multi-head attention throws another twist! Imagine multiple groups (heads) at the party, each focusing on different aspects of the conversation. For instance, one head might concentrate on semantic context, while another might focus on emotional context.\n\n**Here are the details:**\n\n* Each group (head) has its own \"attention weight matrix\" showing how relevant other words are to their focus.\n* They analyze independently, like different games happening at once.\n* In the end, they concatenate (Concat in the image above 👆👆) their insights, creating a richer understanding of each word, like piecing together clues from different groups.\n\n#### **Masked Multi-Head Attention**\nThis is used in the decoder layer to prevent the model from seeing future words. This is achieved by replacing entries above the main diagonal of the attention matrix with `-inf` before performing softmax, a technique known as **Causal Masking**. (Imagine it as putting black tape above the main diagonal of the attention weight matrix).\n\nFor example, in a sentence \"The cat sat on the mat.\", for the word \"sat\", Masked Multi-Head Attention only considers \"The\" and \"cat\", ignoring \"on\", \"the\", and \"mat\".\n\nIn addition to causal masking, a **Padding Mask** is used to prevent the model from attending to `[PAD]` tokens added to equalize the lengths of sequences in a batch. The attention scores of `[PAD]` tokens are set to `-inf`, ensuring these tokens do not affect the final attention output.\n\nIn the case of padding mask, if we have a batch of two sequences: [\"The cat sat down\", \"Good Morning [PAD] [PAD]\"], the model's focus remains solely on the meaningful words in the sequence.\n\nNote: Multi-Head & Masked Multi-Head Attention also have a projection layer (The Linear in the above 👆👆 image). Its job is to project these embeddings, updated from word context, to a more concise form for the Model.\n\n💡Note: In our implementation below instead of creating multiple heads each with their Networks to get queries (Q), keys (K) and values (V), we are going to cleverly use a big network each for getting Q, K, and V and we will share the output of this networks to all the heads (This bascially does the same thing as with creating multiple heads, this is just a more compute effective way).",

   "source": "Let's talk about the newly added portion (the section on top highlighted in green). This section explains how we use the information from the decoder layer (which also incorporates the information from the encoder layer) to predict the next translated word. To do this, we have a linear layer that takes this information and assigns prediction scores (called logits) to every word in our vocabulary.\n\nThe output size of this layer should match the vocabulary size, so that each word has a corresponding score. The higher the score, the more confident the model is that that word is the next one.\n\nWe also have a softmax layer that transforms these scores into probabilities between 0 and 1. These probabilities are then outputted by the model.\n\n📝 Note: We asterisk (*) the softmax function because the specific error function we are going to use in PyTorch (as you will see below) will automatically apply it for us, so we just need to return the logits.\n\nNow we need an error function, which is a function that our model tries to minimize. By minimizing the error, the model learns how to perform our task (language translation in this case).\n\nWe are going to use CrossEntropyLoss as our error function. This function takes the logits representing the model's prediction of the next translated word and compares it with the actual next word. It then gives an error value based on how far off the model's prediction is from the actual word. The model can then adjust itself accordingly (thereby learning).\n\n**Bonus Technical Detail**: CrossEntropyLoss is a negative log loss function. How does this work? Well, we take the logits and apply a softmax function on them to convert them into probabilities between 0 and 1.\n\nWe want the model to predict 1 for the actual next word (meaning the other probabilities will be 0), so how do we get an error value out of these? Well, we apply a logarithm function on the model's prediction of the actual word. If the model correctly predicts 1, then log(1) is 0, so the error value is 0.\n\nThis tells the model that it is on the right track and there is no error. But if the model's prediction is less than 1, then the logarithm function starts to approach $-\\infty$, which means the error value becomes very small.\n\nThis is a problem because we want to minimize the error function, and the way it is shaped now, the model would learn to predict 0 for the right word in order to reduce the error.\n\nSo here is where the trick comes in: we multiply the logarithm function by `-1`, so that now for predictions less than 1, the error value starts to approach $\\infty$ instead. This forces the model to learn to predict 1 for the right word.\n\nThis is why it is called negative log loss: $-log(models\\ prediction \\ for\\ actual\\ next\\ word)$.\n\nNow because we are predicting the next word multiple times in a sample, and for every sample in the batch, we calculate all the error values and average them, so that we have one error value to minimize.\n",

   "source": "### **Beam Search**\nMachine translation models generate output sequences like translated sentences. A common challenge is how to select the best words at each step, given the previous words and the input sequence.\n\nOne simple method is **greedy decoding**, which predicts the most likely word at each step, building the sentence word by word. However, this can lead to suboptimal results as the model might get stuck in local optima, missing better translations overall.\n\nA more sophisticated method is **beam search**, which is a decoding algorithm that can generate sequences of words from a probability distribution over the vocabulary. It is often used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning, where the output is a sequence of words.\n\nUnlike greedy decoding, which only selects the most likely word at each step, beam search keeps track of a fixed number of candidates (called the beam size) and expands them until the end of the sequence or a stop token is reached. This allows beam search to explore more possible sequences and find a better solution than greedy decoding.\n\nThe main steps of beam search are:\n\n1. **Maintain multiple candidate translations (beams).** At each step, instead of just the single best word, we consider the top `k` most likely words for **each existing beam**.\n\n2. **Expand each beam with the chosen word.** This effectively creates `k` new beams for each existing one, exploring different translation paths in parallel.\n\n3. **Evaluate and score new beams.** We consider both the probability of the current word and the overall translation's likelihood based on previous words.\n\n4. **Keep the top `k` beams.** We prune unlikely translations, focusing on the most promising candidates.\n\n5. **Repeat steps 2-4 until reaching a maximum length or end-of-sentence marker.**\n\nBy considering multiple possibilities simultaneously, beam search **increases the chance of finding better translations** compared to greedy decoding. However, it comes with increased computational cost due to handling more candidate sequences.\n\nBeam search is needed because it can improve the quality and diversity of the generated sequences. Beam search can avoid some of the problems of greedy decoding, such as repeating words or generating short and incomplete sentences. Beam search can also generate multiple sequences with different probabilities, which can be useful for tasks that require multiple outputs or evaluation metrics.",
